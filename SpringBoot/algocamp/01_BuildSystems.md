### Why do we need build systems ?
1. We need build systems to - 
  - Compile big projects together.
  - The compilation should include the files created by us and the third party libraries we are dependent on(managing dependencies).
  - After the compilation is done they ultimately give us the final running execuatable.
  - So, The tools which can do both of these things mentioned above are called Build Tools.
  - Eg- maven(java), gradle(java), bazel(java), npm(nodejs), pip(python), crate(rust) etc...
