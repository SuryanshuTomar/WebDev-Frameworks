// => Higher Order Component -

// - A pattern where a funciton takes a component as an argument and return a new component.

// - eg -
// const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)
// const IronMan = withSuit(TonyStark)
// The naming convention of HOC is we have to start the it with "with" keyword and then the functionality of the HOC like - withSuit in the above example.
