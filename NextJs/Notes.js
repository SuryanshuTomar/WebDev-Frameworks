// 1. Routing in a React APP -
//    I. Install a thrid party package
//    II. routes.js file to configure the routes.
//    III. For each route, create a component file, export the component, import it in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property.

// 2. Routing in Next APP -
//    I. File-System based routing mechanism.
//    II. When a file is added to pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a route.
//    III. By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routing patterns.
