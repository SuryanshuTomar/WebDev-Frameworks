// => NEXT JS INTRO AND BASICS -

// 1. By Default, Every component in NextJs13 onwards is a React Server Component. That means these components are rendered server side and not on the client side.
// 2. If we want to render any component client side then we can use, "use client" directive can be used at the top of any component to make a nextjs13 component a React Client Component.
